👋 Hi, I’m John Narvaez
I live in Surrey, British Columbia, Canada and I love solving puzzles and analyzing things. I am also interested in learning about computer-related topics and continually strive to learn new things.

🌱 My skills and education

I finished the Data Scientist bootcamp at Brainstation in September 2023 and I am overly excited to apply the knowledge and skills I gained.
I have experience in data analysis, data cleaning, data visualization, machine learning, and programming languages such as SQL and Python.
I am proficient in using tools such as Microsoft Excel, Tableau, Power BI, Visual Studio Code, and GitHub.

💞️ My goals and interests

I am looking for work and collaboration opportunities with other data analysts/scientists to further enhance my data analytics skills and learn from their expertise.
I am passionate about finding insights from data and creating impactful solutions for real-world problems.
I enjoy exploring new datasets, technologies, and methodologies that can help me improve my data science skills, understanding and knowledge.
